The term \"vegetable\" is a term that refers to a variety of plant material, which may include grains, fruits or vegetables. A \"food,\" as used in the Food and Drugs Act, is a \"food ingredient,\" which may include: a meat, poultry, or fish product, ', \"The cheese is a mixture of cow's milk and ricotta cheese, and the sauce is made with a mix of tomatoes and garlic. It's served on a bed of fresh, soft, shredded lettuce topped with the cheese and a drizzle of olive oil. The restaurant has a full bar, which features a variety of craft beers. The restaurant, which is located at 611 Westheimer, is open for lunch and dinner daily.
